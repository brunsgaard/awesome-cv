Currently, Technical Team Lead at Visma with 7+ years of experience specializing in backend development, distributed systems, infrastructure automation, and cloud native solutions.

I am a logical thinker and have a strong urge to find optimal solutions and ``do things right‚Äù. I believe that engineering is a team effort where thought out software design together with consistent and elegant code is the basis for effective teamwork and long term success of projects.

I enjoy building cloud native software using the best tools available, devising better problem-solving methods for challenging tasks, and learning new technologies and tools when the need arises.

I feel most comfortable in UNIX environments and my main languages are Go and Python, but I have also worked on projects written in Java, C++, JavaScript and Haskell.
